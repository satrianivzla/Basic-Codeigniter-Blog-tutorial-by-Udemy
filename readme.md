	<h2>Updates</h2>
</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Constants</b>:</li>
	I added some constants to the file <b>application/config/constants.php</b> to manage the database conection settings
	<li><b>Navbar</b>:</li>
	I updated the navbar because originally the link <b>Add Post</b> was showed when you are noy logged and of course, you can ended trying to add a new post without been a registered user of this web application. 	 
	Then the Blog controller could be updated to validate that there is a registered user logged in the system before allow to add a new post or any other admin action.
	<li><b>Footer</b>:</li>
	Seeeing the simple footer I just add a couple of link to the Udemy catalog of Codeigniter's courses.
	<li><b>Categories</b>:</li>
	Look like there is no page related to the process of the sidebar that should allow to visitors to get all articles ordered by categories
</ul>

	<h2>Security issues</h2>
</p>
<p> Be carefull with the explanations of this course. In a building process of a quite simple and basic web application like this one, I don't understand how this kind of important security issues were not thinked and more when <a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/frankjohn/" target="_blank"><b>Frank John</b></a> as instructor with almost 10 years of experience of webprogramming, should try to made a good plan of the comtent for this kind of courses, not mmatter that should be taken by beginners of this tecnology, because at the end we are teaching bad practices and behaviours.
